  <body style="background-color:lightpink;">
<p style=>Deriecka Joy Tapia is currently a senior at James Campbell High School. She was born and raised in the beautiful Hawaii Nei. She is the only child of her parents.  She loves to go on adventures with friends and captures in pictures to look back and see how good times were spent with great people. Whether it be going to the beach, a hike, or get together. Important people in Deriecka's life would be her family and friends and she is grateful for each one of them. This includes her parents who have loved her ever since she was in the womb and loved her ever since. Deriecka aspires to be in the medical field after high school. In specific, a registered nurse or a pharmacy technician. She wants to pursue in this career because she loves working with people and it would be an honor if she can help prevent or treat sickness. It's been a dream of Deriecka's to be in the medical field ever since she was in the elementary.</p>
