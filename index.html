      <h3><b>Why I Joined Ap Computer Science</b></h3>
    </div>
      <!--my reason why i joined ap computer science-->
      <p>As junior year passed by, students have to plan out what they wanted on their senior year schedule. Many of Deriecka's friends did AP computer science and recommended her to do the class. So she listened to them and took the class. She found it interesting and wanted to learn coding and more about computers.</p>
